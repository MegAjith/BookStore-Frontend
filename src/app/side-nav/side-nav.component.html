<!-- Side Navigation bar component

    Should contain a header since this is a header, 
    
    the component should not be rendered until the user is logged in (After Auth service is done)

    in Desktop -> should be a side menu with decent width but full height, should be possible to minimize to simple icons
    in mobile -> full width, full height , should be possible to minimize to a single ham burger icon at top left

-->
<header>
    <p>side-nav works!</p>
</header>
